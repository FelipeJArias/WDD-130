      <h3>Colors</h3>
      <p>
        MTG has five different colors. Each color has a different characteristic, sometimes like a personality! 
        Red is fast, with cards that allow the players to burn their enemies and deals great amounts of damage but can ran out of gas easily. 
        Blue is patient, countering the enemy strategy and giving more cards to work with, but can struggle to win the game because it has the weakest creatures. 
        Understanding the colors and theirs strengthens and weaknesses will help you to choose the color combination that fits your style and strategy. </p>

        <p>White – Green – Red – Blue – Green</p>
 
        <p>You can check the color of each card by looking at the upper right corner. 
        Unless it rules say something else, the card’s color is equal to mana symbols in its costs. </p>

      <h3>Archetypes</h3>
      <p>Smash your opponent! Control the battle with powerful spells! Combine cards! </p>

        <p>An Archetypes in MTG is the kind of the deck’s strategy. 
        Each strategy use cards with specific mana costs or functions in the game to support it. 
        The main strategies are Aggro, Control and Combo. Knowing your strategy will help to make good decisions. 
        Knowing your opponent strategy will help you to make the best decisions! 
        Being able to adapt, either attacking or waiting, is vital to win the battle!</p>

        <p>Aggro Decks</p>

        <p>Aggressive decks, usually called as Aggro decks, use low mana cost cards, such as powerful and simple creatures, damage spells or snowballing cards to win as fast as possible. 
        Using Aggro decks, your normally will set the pace of the game. Even though Aggro decks are sticking to it strategy, Aggro decks players must pay attention to your opponent’s decisions. 
        Either you’re playing against a combo, control, or any other deck slower than yours, if your opponent finds any space to breath, you might see the victory slipping from your hands.</p>

        <p>Control Dekcs</p>

        <p>Control decks are the opposite of Aggressive decks. 
        Control decks uses target removals against strategy creatures, mass removals against armies of creatures, counter spells against key spells from your opponent and card advantage cards to manage all those things, until it reaches a point in the game where there’s no way for your opponent beats you. 
        That’s when Control decks have a chance to win the game by using incredible and expansive spells that will win the game by itself. Patience and decision making are essential to play Control decks.</p>

        <p>Combo Decks</p>

        <p>Combo decks are essentially trying to combine two cards to create amazing interactions, such as an infinite damage loop, an infinite number of creatures, generating (or ramping) greats amounts of mana to play powerful spells way earlier than normal. 
        Combo decks players should be prepared to defense themselves against Aggro decks attacks while their working in their combo or run the combo before Control decks has the chance to stabilize the battlefield.</p>

        <p>Also, is important to find the color combination that fits your archetype. 
        Blue is slower and provides card selection, so is very strong in control or combo decks, and harder to fit into an aggressive strategy. 
        Green has ramping cards and huge creatures, so is good on combo or Aggro decks.</p>

        <p>There are other adaptions and variables for each archetype, such as midrange decks, tempo decks. 
        Regardless of your archetype, your deck should be ready to face anything – the opposite/counter strategy or even the same deck!</p>
